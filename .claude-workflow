# CISK Navigator - Development Workflow Instructions

## Version Management
- **App Version**: Located in `app.py` as `APP_VERSION` constant (currently 2.2.9)
- **YAML Data Version**: Specified in each YAML file's `meta.version` field

## For Every Change:
1. **Increment the appropriate version** (x.y.z+1):
   - **Patch** (x.y.z+1): Bug fixes, small tweaks, minor improvements
   - **Minor** (x.y+1.0): New features, enhancements, significant changes
   - **Major** (x+1.0.0): Breaking changes, major refactors, API changes

2. **Update version in `app.py`**:
   ```python
   APP_VERSION = "x.y.z"
   ```

3. **Test on local server**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mounir.dous/projects/CISK-Navigator
   python app.py
   ```
   - Server runs on http://localhost:5001
   - Verify changes work correctly
   - Test with sample YAML files in the data/ directory

4. **DO NOT commit to GitHub unless explicitly requested by user**

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] YAML files load correctly (both enhanced and legacy formats)
- [ ] Generated HTML displays properly
- [ ] Interactive features work (navigation, search, filters, priority sorting)
- [ ] Both app version and YAML data version display correctly
- [ ] Multi-link relationships work (challenges, initiatives, systems, KPIs)
- [ ] Weights and impacts display properly

## Current Versions:
- **App Version**: 2.2.9 (CISK Navigator Generator application)
- **YAML Data Version**: Defined per data file (e.g., "2.1.19" in full_sample_enhanced.yaml)

## Key Features:
- Enhanced format with multi-links
- Challenge/sub-challenge priorities (1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low)
- Initiative → multiple challenges (with weight & impact)
- System → multiple initiatives (with weight)
- KPI → multiple systems (with weight)
- Auto-detection of enhanced vs legacy YAML format

## Notes:
- The app version is for the generator software itself
- The YAML version is for the data structure/schema version
- Both versions should be displayed in the generated HTML
- Always test with both enhanced and legacy YAML formats
